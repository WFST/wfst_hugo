The WFST shear catalog is one of the products of galaxy formation study with position, galaxy shape, photometric redshift and calibrated biases as a function of resolution and SNR. Combining with the existing spectroscopic data set in the northern sky, e.g. SDSS and future ones such as LAMOST2, it will significantly benefit the study of weak gravitational lensing. Especially the constraint on galaxy formation and cosmology will be improved. We will address the science in three aspects related to weak lensing analysis, i.e. galaxy-halo connection, halo assembly and cluster detection. There are two other important scientific subjects also can be done using WFST imaging data. With the deep u band imaging, it is possible to also detect a large sample of $u$ band drop out galaxy and low surface brightness galaxies.
