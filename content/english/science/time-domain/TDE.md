A breakthrough in transient research during the past decade is the discovery of a rapidly growing number of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) thanks to a variety of wide-field optical telescopes dedicated to time-domain surveys. TDEs arouse broad interest in the community due to their distinctive scientific values. First of all, TDEs provide direct evidence for the existence of a SMBH in a quiescent galaxy beyond the current accessible regime that is based on stellar or gas dynamics. Moreover, TDEs serve as an ideal laboratory to scrutinize the accretion physics of SMBHs and tackle unsettled problems in AGNs by monitoring the entire life cycle of BH activity.

However, plenty of open questions about TDEs are yet to be answered. For instance, the TDEs found as yet exhibit an unexpected preference for post-starburst galaxies, which cannot be addressed by known selection effects. In addition, the observed total energy is one to two orders of magnitude lower than theoretical prediction, leading to the "missing energy" puzzle. Also, the highly debatable origin of the bright optical-UV emission awaits more observational constraints. An associated issue is the connection between optically-selected and X-ray-selected TDEs, and the feasibility of constructing a simple model to unify them remains unclear. WFST, in synergy with other multi-wavelength/messenger time domain facilities in the upcoming decade, offers an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these (and many other) challenging questions.
