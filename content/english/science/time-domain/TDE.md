A breakthrough in transient research during the past decade is the detection of a rapidly growing number of tidal disruption events (TDEs). A TDE occurs when a star occasionally wanders into the tidal sphere of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) residing in the center of a galaxy. The star will be tidally disrupted and partially accreted, producing a flash of electromagnetic radiation on timescales of months to years. The event rate is lower than supernova by a factor of a few hundred, i.e. $10^{-4}-10^{-5}~\rm gal^{-1}~yr^{-1}$, placing TDEs in a class of rare transients.

Already theoretically predicted in the 1970s, TDEs were not identified until late in the 1990s from the archival ROSAT data as well as a few more subsequent events identified by XMM-Newton and Chandra, guided by the anticipation of a radiation peak in soft X-ray or extreme UV bands. These TDEs, however, were all found serendipitously from archival data and synergetic information in other wavelength regimes is scarce.

As significant as the scientific values and advancement, plenty of open questions about TDEs are yet to be answered. For instance, the TDEs found as yet exhibit an unexpected preference for post-starburst (or so-called ''E+A'') galaxies, which cannot be addressed by known selection effects. In addition, the observed total energy is one to two orders of magnitude lower than theoretical prediction, leading to the ``missing energy'' puzzle. Also, the highly debatable origin of the bright optical-UV emission awaits more observational constraints. An associated issue is the connection between optically-selected and X-ray-selected TDEs, and the feasibility of constructing a simple model to unify them remains unclear. From an observational perspective, the mounting number of nuclear transients, both in normal and active galaxies, has raised a fundamental question: how to classify these transients (e.g. TDEs, turned-on AGNs, sporadic gas accretion, etc.) into different types of SMBH transient accretion events? WFST, in synergy with other multi-wavelength/messenger time domain facilities in the upcoming decade, offers an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these (and many other) challenging questions.
