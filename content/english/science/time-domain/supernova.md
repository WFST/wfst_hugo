The observation of supernovae (SNe) has a long history. The first reliably recorded SN, "SN~185'', dated back to AD 185, was reported in $\it{Book\ of\ the\ Later\ Han\ Dynasty}$ by ancient Chinese astronomers. Since then, over 100 SNe were spotted before 1990s. Thanks to the wide application of large-array CCD cameras in wide-field transient survey projects, the discovery rate of SNe has been increasing exponentially over the last few decades. In particular, the growing discoveries of SNe within a few days of the explosion ("early-phase supernovae") through ongoing transient surveys bring new breakthroughs, challenging existing theory of stellar evolution and SN explosions. 

In 2020s, growth spurts of SN detections in both northern and southern hemispheres are expected, resulting from deep and wide-field surveys conducted by WFST and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The operation of the WFST transient survey allows us to anticipate detection of tens of thousands of SNe from the 6-years survey project. Over one hundred early-phase supernovae are expected to be discovered every year. Extreme and rare transients such as super-luminous, (pulsational) pair-instability, and gravatiationally lensed SNe can be promisingly detected by WFST from local to high-$z$ universe. Moreover, breakthroughs in searching new SN subclasses and SN-related transients such as fast blue optical/ultraluminous transients are highly expected thanks to the unique deep high-cadence $u$-band survey with WFST. The wealth of well-observed SNe discovered by WFST will remarkably deepened our understanding of stellar evolution, the SN explosion mechanism, the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and the fundamental physics of the universe.
