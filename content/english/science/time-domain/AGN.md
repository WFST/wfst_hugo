Residing in the centers of active galaxies, the luminous quasars, or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in general, are the manifestation of gas accretion onto massive black holes (BHs) and are believed to play a key role in regulating the evolution of massive galaxies. Despite that the accretion-BH scenario of the central engine of AGNs has been established since the discovery of quasars over sixty years ago, many fundamental questions remain unresolved. For instance, how do SMBHs acquire their gas? What mechanism is responsible for their variability over a wide range of wavelength? Are their activities triggered in a persistent or an episodic mode, and what are the conditions at work, in either case?

Thanks to the upcoming deep and high-resolution WFST images, constructing a sample of considerably close AGN pairs is foreseeable by virtue of the unique AGN colors, such that inspection of the triggering mechanism of AGN activity is made possible. In addition, the long-term variability as well as the deep WFST stacked images (to a depth of $r \sim 25$ mag) will be of service to identify and characterize quasar candidates fainter than the the completeness limit of SDSS spectroscopy. These quasar candidates will then be readily observable targets for subsequent major spectroscopic programs (e.g. LAMOST-II and MUST) that explore even fainter AGNs at high redshift with lower BH masses with an ultimate goal of attaining a panoramic view of the BH growth and its co-evolution with galaxy and tracking down the cosmological evolution of the intergalactic medium and the large-scale structure of the universe.
