Stellar transients results from a variety of processes in stellar evolution, including the explosive death (e.g. SNe and Gamma Ray Bursts or GRBs), the violent behaviors of the compact remnants of the explosion (e.g. pulsars and possibly Fast Radio Bursts or FRBs), as well as processes related to the merger of binaries (e.g. Gravitational Wave Events or GWEs). Among these transients, SNe and GRBs are possibly neutrino-related events. In this section, we discuss the observation plans of stellar transients with WFST.
