On 2017 August 17 at 12:41:04.47 UTC, the first BNS merger GW source GW170817 was detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo. After the GW detection alert was triggered (∼ 1.7 s), the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the sGRB GRB170817A which lasted about 2 s. Based on the sky map constrained by the GW and sGRB signal, telescopes all around the world started to search for the optical counterpart of GW170817. Finally, their optical counterpart—the kilonova AT2017gfo was found in NGC4993.

Kilonovae are approximately thermal transients, produced by mergers of binary neutron stars and NS-black hole binaries. Combined with a GW signal, the observation of the kilonova can offer vital information for constraining the Hubble constant, the source of Galactic $r$-process enrichment, and the equations of state of neutron stars. With a FoV of 6.55 deg$^2$, WFST is planned to search for kilonovae of GW events in upcoming observation run of GW detectors, whose time plan is shown in Figure 1. In the upcoming O4 and O5, WFST is ecpected to cover most GW events and help to discover more kilonovae.
