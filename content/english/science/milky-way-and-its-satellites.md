# Star Formation

## Young Stars

The mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$) is a crucial parameter for understanding the evolution and dissipation of circumstellar disks, and therefore also for understanding the process of planet formation. Young stars commonly show accretion variability at various timescales caused by different physical mechanisms, e.g. non-steady accretion on timescales of hours, the global instabilities of the magnetospheric structure on timescales of months \cite{1996A&A...314..835G,2003A&A...409..169B}. In addition, the interaction between circumstellar disks and the  young massive planets could induce pulsed accretion activities \cite{2018ApJ...853L..34B}. A search for pulsed accretion activities from young stars also provide us a new tool to search for young massive planets.  Measurement of accretion rates for the young stars in such environments provide us a way to understand the evolution of circumstellar disks in low-metallicity environments.



Gas from the disk is lifted out of the disk midplane by magnetic pressure and is funneled onto the star along the magnetic field lines. The infalling flow hits the stellar surface at approximately the free-fall velocity, causing a strong ``accretion shock'' on the stellar surface \cite{2016ARA&A..54..135H}. Ultraviolet/optical excess emissions arise as the gravitational energy of the infalling material in  accretion processes is radiated away in the accretion shock and thus have been used as a very direct measure of the accretion rate \cite{1998ApJ...492..323G}. The WFST survey will include the $u$ band which cover the Balmer excess emission and provide the $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ measurement among the best methods. Figure~\ref{Fig:Acc} (left) shows a relation between the WFST u-band brightness and the accretion luminosity for a sample of young stars in the literature \cite{2014A&A...561A...2A}. The WFST synthetic observation are performed on their VLT/X-shooter spectra and the accretion luminosity are taken from \cite{2014A&A...561A...2A}. The tight correlation shown in the figure promises that WFST u-band photometry can provide accurate measurements of accretion rates for young stars.  Using the data from the Gaia EDR3 and allWise, we collect more than $\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{4}$ young stars with circumstellar disks which can be observed by WFST, see the right panel in Figure~\ref{Fig:Acc}. Thus, with WFST we will measure the accretion rates and their variability for a large sample of young stars for the first time.


## Accretion Burst Events

How young stars gain mass from surrounding environment through disk accretion is still a open question. Traditional models usually assume a steady accretion with a constant accretion rate \cite{shu1987}. However, these steady accretion models predict significantly higher luminosity than observed for the young stars \cite{kenyon1990}. To solve this ``luminosity problem", Kenyon\,\&\,Hartmann (1995) \cite{kenyon1995} proposed a episodic accretion scenario, which assumes that a large fraction of total disk accretion occurs in some short-lived bursts. Accretion bursts were first observed for the low-mass young stars \cite{1996ARA&A..34..207H}, and recently have been observed for a few high-mass young stars \cite{2021ApJ...922...90C}. However, it is unclear how often young stars remain accretion outburst phase and which mechanisms drive the their accretion outbursts. 

{\bf EXors and FUors} are two types of young stars which are believed to undergo accretion outbursts. Fuors phenomenon are most prominent during the star formation stages. FUors increase in brightness by 5 magnitudes or more within one year and remain bright for decades \cite{1996ARA&A..34..207H}, while EXor outbursts have relative shorter timescales ($\sim$yrs) and lower amplitude \cite{2014prpl.conf..387A}. It is still unclear there are any physical distinctions between them because there are too few known FUors and lack of observational data for these FUors before their outbursts. Among $\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{4}$ young stars with circumstellar disks which will be monitered by WFST, it is expected to detect the 0.5-7 FUor outburst events per year according to the PTF survey \cite{2015ApJ...808...68H}. While a combination of data from all-sky infrared surveys can fully characterize the evolutionary stages of these young stars, the WFST time-domain survey will significantly contribute in understanding the accretion history of the young stars during different evolutionary stages. 


## Mapping the Milky way

### 3D dust distribution

Dust distribution is a necessary piece of the Galactic structure studies. Dust extinction is a commonly-used dust mapping technique. By measuring the reddening and extinction towards a large number of stellar objects, a continuous dust density distribution can be recovered. Based on the modern wide-field optical photometric and spectroscopic survey data such as SDSS, Pan-STARRS1, and Gaia, the three-dimensional (3D) Galactic dust distribution can be mapped in the arcmin-scale spatial resolution, with which the structures of dust Galactic disk such as warp and spiral arms have been revealed \cite{sale2014,chenbq2019,green2019,guo2021}. The WFST survey is over 2$-$3 magnitude deeper than Pan-STARRS1 (in $r$ band). Therefore we expect to obtain 3D dust maps using WFST data with higher resolution and dynamical range than previous 3D maps, which will be helpful to trace the Galactic dense regions associated with star formation and constrain the Galactic models. Especially, the high sensitivity  and photometric accuracy of the WFST survey will allows us to investigate the diffuse interstellar medium at high Galactic latitude such as the intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) that are considered as an inflow of gas consisting of recycled disk material and thus believed to be connected to a Galactic fountain process \cite{rohser2016}.

### Stellar Clusters

Stellar clusters in the Milky Way are ideal test beds for the stellar evolution from the pre-main sequence to the post-main sequence, given by the large age spread over several magnitudes from a few to tens of Myr (open clusters) to a few to tens of Gyr (globular clusters) \cite{2016A&A...588A..40R,2021MNRAS.508.2688G}. The co-eval, co-spatial, and iso-metallic stellar members provide abundant information of the stellar astrophysics. Despite their importance to stellar astrophysics, most star clusters have been relatively poorly studied due to their large distances or their large angular sizes. 



The detecting limit of the finally stacked images from WFST survey in the $r$ band goes to $r=25$ mag, 2$-$3 magnitude deeper than the Pan-STARRS1 survey. For the open clusters confined in the galactic plane, Figure~\ref{Fig:cluster} estimates the minimum stellar mass detected by WFST varying with distance from near to far. For clusters with distances within the 5~kpc from the sun, WFST can resolve stellar mass down to $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, and ensure rather complete mass estimate for these open clusters. The relative young open clusters and the even younger embedded clusters (better studied in the IR wavelengths) represent the current star formation rate of the Milky Way \cite{2016ApJ...833..229L}. The 3D distributions of these two types of young clusters map the 3D star formation rates of the Milky Way, which, together with the 3D molecular gas map \cite{2019ApJS..240....9S}, provide the largest view of baryon cycle of the Milky Way. For the nearby ($\lesssim$1\,kpc) young clusters, WFST's accuracy, sensitivity, and multi-epoch observations allow for the detection of their members down to the brown dwarf mass range, a much better characterization of low-mass star formation in stellar clusters, and an deep investigation of initial mass functions. 

{\it Gaia} mission has provided a list of reliable members for more than 200  known clusters within 2~kpc from the Sun \cite{2018A&A...618A..93C}. These clusters range in age from 10~Myr to several Gyr \cite{2019A&A...623A.108B} and thus are excellent calibrators for the mass–dependent relationship between stellar rotation and age. While ones obtain the ages of these clusters from color-magnitude fitting using the Gaia data \cite{2019A&A...623A.108B}, the rotation periods of individual members in each cluster can be derived from the WFST time-domain survey. A calibrated mass–dependent relationship between stellar rotation and age will be the key to investigating the star formation history of the milky way. 




### Structure of the Milky Way

The stellar structure of the Milky Way is composed of four components: a bulge, a thin disk, a thick disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. The knowledge of the structure of the Milky Way has been significantly improved with the data from various surveys, e.g. SDSS, Pan-STARRS, LAMOST, and Gaia, and  the development of new technologies. However, there are still many unknown issues about the fine structures of the Milky Way, and there are still many unresolved problems in its formation mechanism.  


As a space facility, the GAIA satellite can observe the entire sky, while its magnitude limit is $\sim20$~mag and it is not suitable for studying dense stellar fields. In order to investigate the precise structures of the Milky Way and their formation mechanism, it is necessary to perform a deep survey which covers a large field of view and can detect a larger number of low-mass stars to large distances, see the bottom panel in Figure~\ref{Fig:distance}. An accurate three-dimensional distribution of stars in the Milky Way and a decomposition of the Milky Way into different components are crucial for constraining the formation mechanism of different components of the Milky Way. To distinguish the different components, one need to measure the metallicities of individual stars which requires deep and high precision photometric data in $ugr$ bands \cite{ive2008}. Current surveys with large field of views are either lack of the $u$-band filter (e.g. Pan-STARRS) or too shallow in $u$-band (e.g. SDSS or SkyMapper). The up-coming LSST will reach a depth of $r=27$ mag from the co-added images, but its observational area is limited in the southern sky.
