In this subsection we introduce two major programs of the WFST 6-years survey, the Wide-field Survey and the Deep High-cadence $u$-band Survey, which are designed to meet the constraints imposed by major science objectives of WFST by coordinating the survey depth, area, and cadence. Each program will use about 45\% observing time of the WFST 6-years survey. In addition to the two major survey programs, we are also considering smaller survey programs, which would use the remaining $\sim$ 10\% of the time (about 1,300 hours over 6 years) for specific purposes, such as intensive observations of sky region that may not be well covered by the two major programs (e.g., Galactic plane) and time-critical objects.

The WFST Wide-field Survey will cover $\sim$ 8,000 deg$^2$ of sky in the northern hemisphere in four broad bands ($u, g, r, i$) with a single exposure of 30s, which yields about 90 visits per pointing per band over 6 years assuming a clear night fraction of 70\% at Lenghu site \cite{deng21}. To achieve a long-term monitoring purpose for specific objects such as active galactic nuclei and variables, single-band visits will be evenly distributed in 6 years, i.e., 60 multiband visits (15 visits $\times$ 4 bands) per pointing per year, corresponding to yearly raw data of about 100 TB of whole Wide-field Survey fields. Specifically, observations for about 300 different pointings ($\sim$ 2,000 deg$^2$) with 60 visits per pointing would be carried out through the Wide-field Survey in three months and total about 1,200 pointings would be covered by the Wide-field Survey every year. All $u$-band observations are scheduled in dark and grey time, as the $u$ band is the band where the most sky background-sensitive measurements are planned. In order to balance the survey efficiency and science goals and to optimize the homogeneity of visits taken from the WFST Wide-field Survey, basically, we plan to conduct observations in two bands every night and avoid consecutive observations in the same band except for the $u$ band, which gives a reasonable cadence and time span of multiband light curves for general purposes of transient-related studies, e.g., transient classifications, variability statistics, and time-domain cosmology. On the other hand, the total integration time in each band will reach $\sim 45$ min over 6 years, deeper than any single-telescope surveys which have comparable survey area in the northern-hemisphere.

To make the best use of the superior $u$-band imaging performance of WFST in time-domain astronomy, in addition to the Wide-field Survey, we plan to carry out the WFST Deep High-cadence $u$-band Survey that will routinely monitor $2~\times \sim360$ deg$^2$ sky regions surrounding the equator every year (the ``Spring" and ``Autumn" fields; 6 months for each). Given the importance of $u$-band and color information in understanding the nature of various energetic transient phenomena, for each 6-months campaign, the Deep High-cadence $u$-band Survey would ensure at least two-bands photometries (one must be $u$ band) in hour cadence in consecutive $\pm$ 7 days from the new moon every lunar cycle; and a multiband ancillary survey would keep monitoring the same region in the rest of nights of the 6 months. Such an innovative survey mode provides a unique opportunity of studying transients soon after their occurrences and discovering rare energetic explosive phenomena in the universe (e.g., early-phase supernovae, fast blue optical transients, tidal disruption events, kilonovae; refer \S \ref{section_31}--\S \ref{section_33} for details). Moreover, together with the next-generation Chinese space missions (e.g., the Einstein Probe (EP) \cite{EP18}; the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) \cite{CSST21}) that will be launched in the coming years, synchronized multi-wavelength surveys thus can be expected by using both ground-based and space wide-field survey facilities for the first time. By coordinating with EP and CSST observations, we are able to not only promptly identify optical counterparts of various high-energy astronomical phenomena but also get real-time spectral energy distributions of various fast transients via the synchronized multi-wavelength surveys.

Wide-field imaging has become a mainstream tool in various fields of astronomy as can be witnessed by the success of previous/ongoing wide-field survey projects. The excellent survey capability and high $u$-band sensitivity of WFST opens new opportunities to explore the transient sky, which will add to the legacy by exploring sky in the northern hemisphere with a greater depth and width especially in blue optical wavelengths. A large amount of multi-color light curves with cadences from hours to years enable us to systematically study photometric behavior of transients with different timescales from local to high-$z$ universe. With the 6-years $u$-band data, the final stacked images can reach $\gtrsim$ 26 mag (5$\sigma$) for over 1,000 deg$^2$ Deep High-cadence $u$-band fields, comparable to the depth of final  Vera C. Rubin/LSST $u$-band products after 10 years. Together with the WFST Wide-field Survey, in addition to tens of thousands of multiband light curves, data products such as week-lensing shape catalogs with photometric redshift and shape information of over 200 million galaxies, $\sim40$ thousand photometric selected galaxy clusters, and reference catalogs of astrometry, parallax, proper motion for stars as fainter as 23 mag will bring a great legacy value to the entire astronomical community in the era of 20--40m class optical and near-infrared telescopes, wide-field spectroscopic survey facilities (e.g., the MUltiplexed Survey Telescope, the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph), and space survey missions (e.g., CSST, Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope).
