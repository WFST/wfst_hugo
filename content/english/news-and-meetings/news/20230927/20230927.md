In October, the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) will embark on a three-month pilot survey, laying the foundation for its upcoming six-year mission scheduled to commence in 2024. One of the primary objectives of WFST is to identify tens of thousands of exploding stars known as supernovae. The team aims to detect approximately 100 supernovae each year within a few days of their explosive demise. This pilot survey will provide invaluable experience and data for the team to refine the survey process and prepare for the forthcoming long-term mission. By searching for these exploding stars, WFST will make significant contributions to our understanding of stellar lifecycles and cosmic evolution.
