**University of Science and Technology of China - Purple Mountain Observatory's Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) Infrastructure Project Completes Acceptance**

On July 13, 2023, the acceptance meeting for the supporting infrastructure project of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) - Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) was held at Lenghu. The meeting was attended by representatives from Lenghu Science and Technology Innovation Industrial Park Management Committee, Qinghai Tongtai Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., University of Science and Technology of China, Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yunnan Observatory, Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, China Investment Engineering Inspection and Testing Co., Ltd., Qinghai Dongya Engineering Construction Management Consulting Co., Ltd., as well as relevant experts from Mangya City Construction and Transportation Quality Inspection Station. 

The experts first visited the site at Saishiteng Mountain, where the expert team for the construction and installation of the dome conducted on-site testing and recorded performance parameters related to the dome, according to the "Outline of 17.1-meter Dome Inspection for 2.5-meter Caliber Wide-Field Survey Telescope." Simultaneously, the expert team for the infrastructure project inspected and evaluated the supporting observation building for the wide-field survey telescope.
