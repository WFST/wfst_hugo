On November 22, 2023, the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC) issued an announcement confirming the discovery of two near-Earth asteroids, 2023 WX1 and 2023 WB2, by the WFST. This marks the first batch of near-Earth asteroids discovered by the WFST.

The near-Earth asteroids 2023 WX1 and 2023 WB2 were both first observed on November 18th, with apparent magnitudes of 20.8 and 21.0, respectively. Their apparent motion speeds were measured at 0.513 degrees per day and 1.006 degrees per day. After accumulating observations from multiple observation stations, the orbits of 2023 WX1 and 2023 WB2 have been determined. The minimum orbital intersection distance between 2023 WX1 and Earth is calculated to be 0.0416 astronomical units, with an estimated diameter of approximately 170 meters.

One of the scientific objectives of the WFST is to conduct a survey of celestial bodies in the solar system. Since its first light on September 17th this year, the WFST has embarked on test observations of solar system small bodies. As the most advanced optical transient survey instrument globally, the WFST has already demonstrated its powerful survey capabilities. As of now, under the leadership of Researcher Haibin Zhao, the WFST Solar System Object research team has discovered a group of new main-belt asteroids. They have also achieved the rediscovery of multiple near-Earth asteroids such as 2004 XO and 2008 WY13, with a number of near-Earth asteroid candidates awaiting confirmation through subsequent tracking.
