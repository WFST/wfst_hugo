Following the detection of GRB 231110A by SWIFT (Dâ€™Elia et al., GCN 34977) and MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCN 34978), WFST observed the target position with 13x60s and 27x90s exposure in i-band starting from 10 Nov 2023, UTC 05:59:01, about 39.45 minutes after the burst. After stacking the individual exposures (5x90s) to enhance observation depth, WFST found two possible candidates.
