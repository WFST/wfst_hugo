The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a 2.5m optical telescope with primary-focus optics designed for a wide 3$^{\circ}$ field of view. A 3-D sketch of the telescope structure is shown in Figure 1, where telescope tube consists of a square center hub, the lower and upper Serrurier trusses, the primary focus ring, four spider plates, and the primary-focus assembling tube. The lower and upper Serrurier trusses are connected with the lower and upper surfaces of the central hub, respectively. The primary focus ring sits on the top of the upper Serrurier truss and provides support for the primary-focus assembling tube through the triangle spider plates.

A mosaic CCD camera, a set of corrector lenses, a filter exchanging mechanism and a field de-rotation and re-focusing mechanism are integrated into a unit known as a primary-focus assembly (PFA). The PFA is attached to the primary-focus assembling tube via a hexapod mechanism that leads to fine alignment of the PFA relative to the primary mirror.

The primary mirror is located at the other end of the telescope tube, which is assembled on an alt-azimuth mount. Ball-bearings are utilized on both the elevation and azimuth axes, and the rotation is driven by direct drive torque motors for high stiffness and precision. An auto-guiding system based on focal-plane guide sensors is employed to conduct closed-loop tracking during operation. The top-level telescope specifications are listed in Table 1.

Based on the system design specifications, relevant available data, and adopting a V-band sky background level of 22.0 mag arcsec$^{\-2}$, the limiting magnitude of WFST is presented in Table 2.
