## Recruitment

The Department of Astronomy at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) invites applications for two postdoctoral positions in the context of Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) project. The 2.5-meter WFST has been jointly constructed by USTC and Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). It is now in the commissioning phase since its first light on September 17th, 2023, and is expected to start the regular survey in mid-2024. It is a world-class survey facility on the northern hemisphere. It will survey up to 6000 square degrees in multiple colors per night, reaching 23th magnitude for with high-precision photometry and astrometry (see also Wang et al. 2023, SCPMA).  

One selected candidate would work on WFST data reduction pipeline, data analysis and data management. Those candidates who had previous experience in utilizing or developing other data reduction pipelines are preferred. The other selected candidate would work on topics related to WFST project, such as time-domain astronomy, solar system objects and near-field cosmology.

Successful candidates will receive an annual salary of 270,000 RMB at minimum, up to around 420,000 RMB. The university also provides generous benefits on medical insurance and children daycare. All successful applicants are encouraged to apply for the USTC Youth Innovation Research Fund.  

The starting dates for the positions are negotiable. A Ph.D. degree in astronomy, physics or a related discipline is a prerequisite for commencing the position. The initial appointment is two years, but may be extended to up to 6 additional years (with the rank promoted to non-tenure Research Associate Professor) contingent on performance and funding. Tenure promotion to associate or full professor is possible for outstanding candidates.
To apply, please prepare a CV/resume, a list of publications, a statement of research interests, and arrange for at least three letters of reference. All these documents are to be sent to Prof. Lulu Fan by email $\bf{llfan@ustc.edu.cn}$ with the subject "USTC-WFST Postdoc Application/Your Name". The subject of the email for submitting reference letters should read "USTC-WFST Reference Letter/Your Name". The positions remain open until filled. Further inquiries are also directed to Prof. Lulu Fan via the email above.
