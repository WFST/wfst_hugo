## Wide Field Survey Telescope
*University of Science and Technology of China; Purple Mountain Observatory*

Time-domain astronomy through large-scale repeated observations, exploring various astronomical objects and new phenomena in the
universe, and monitoring the time variation of various astronomical objects, is a new direction for astronomy to have major
scientific opportunities.
## Overview
The wide field survey telescope (WFST), jointly developed by the University of Science and Technology of China and the Purple
Mountain Observatory, is the largest time-domain survey facility in the northern hemisphere. WFST is characterized by a 2.5-meter primary mirror and a prime-focus camera with a field of view (FOV) 6.5 square degrees filled with 9 × 9K × 9K mosaic CCD detectors, making WFST one of the most powerful
transient survey facilities in the 2020s. With an atmospheric distortion corrector, its advanced optical design promises a homogeneous and distortion-free image quality that 80% energy of a point source falls within 0.4 arcsecond across the entire FOV. The image quality holds in the $u, g, r, i, z$ and $w$ bands.
## Science Goals
1. Survey the northern sky with the highest sensitivity to explore the variable universe and catch up the time-domain events, such as supernovae, tidal disruption events, multi-messenger events or unknowns in the current framework of astrophysics;
2. Find and track one million solar system objects for a panchromatic view of the solar system and understand its kinematic
evolution; discover planets or their moons in the Kuiper Belt and beyond; 
3. Provide high-precision astrometric and photometric catalogs of objects down to $r$ <25 mag, allowing us to precisely map structures
of the Milky Way and the nearby universe;
4. Place remarkably improved constraints on galaxy-halo connection, cluster characterization and cosmology with WFST 6-years stacked images.
