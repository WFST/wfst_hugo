## Science Goals

1. Survey the northern sky with the highest sensitivity to explore the variable universe and catch up different kinds of extragalactic transient events, which are either science breakthroughs such as early-phase supernovae, fast blue transients, tidal disruption events, multi-messneger conterparts or unknown in the current framework of astrophysics.

2. Find and track one million solar system objects for a panchromatic view of the solar system and understand its kinematic evolution; discover planets or their moons in the Kuiper Belt and beyond; improve their positioning and charaterizations.

3. The stacked imaging data of WFST are a valuable legacy to exploit the Milky way and galaxy formation. The deep photometry improves the 3D dust mapping of the Galaxy and help pin down the number of dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky way, rendering a direct test of the long-standing ``missing satellite'' problem.

4. The 6-year WFST survey data promises to place remarkably improved constraints on galaxy-halo connection, cluster characterization and cosmology. The legacy shape catalog to be combined with other survey data or even further with BAO, SNe Ia, time-delay and CMB measurements will facilitate a joint analysis anticipated to tighten a variety of cosmological constraints.
